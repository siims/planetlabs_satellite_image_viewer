# planetlabs Satellite Image Viewer
Main functionality, as the name hints, is to view planetlabs (https://www.planet.com/) satellite imagery with simple next-previous image navigation.

Assumptions:
 * planet labs api key (which you can obtain from planet labs https://www.planet.com/explorers/)
 * modern browser (tested on chrome)

Used:
 * planetlabs api js client (https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-js)
 * openlayers 3 for json to geoJson conversion (https://github.com/openlayers/ol3)
